# How to contribute ?

## Contribute by _**testing**_ Vuethers
1) Test the library's features
2) Observe a bug or an improvement that could be made
3) Report it by [creating an issue](https://github.com/0Lilian/vuethers/issues/new)

## Contribute by _**coding**_ Vuethers
- If you have found a bug or a potential improvement for the library and want to code it, we would be happy to accept your PRs!
  **Important :** It'd be good to talk about it beforehand to make sure that no one else is working on it. You can [open an issue](https://github.com/0Lilian/Vuethers/issues/new) for this.
- If you want to code but don't know where to start :
  1) Check out the issues labelled "[help wanted](https://github.com/0Lilian/vuethers/labels/help%20wanted)".
  2) Check out [our roadmap](https://github.com/0Lilian/vuethers/projects/1) and choose an unassigned task

**Here are the steps to contribute to the Vuethers's code :**
1) Fork this repository
2) Clone your fork on your computer using `git clone https://github.com/<YourGithubName>/vuethers.git`
3) In local, navigate into the cloned folder called `vuethers/`
4) Add the Vuethers project repository as the "upstream" remote using `git remote add upstream https://github.com/0Lilian/vuethers.git`
5) Now you can easily pull the new updates on the Vuethers repository using `git pull upstream main`
5) Apply changes in your local repository
6) Commit your changes using `git add -A` + `git commit -m "<YourChangesDescription>"`
7) Push your changes to your fork repository using `git push origin main`
8) Return to your fork on Github, refresh the page and you should see an highlighted area that invites you to initiate a Pull Request. (alternatively you can click on the "New pull request" button)
