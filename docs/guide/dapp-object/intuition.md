## Vuethers' approach





To add in intuition text :
- managing all the datas under the `dapp` object removes the requirements of a lot of imports and made the code simpler and more maintainable
- also all those imports and instanciations are safely managed by Vuethers which removes a lot of repetitive tasks to developers
