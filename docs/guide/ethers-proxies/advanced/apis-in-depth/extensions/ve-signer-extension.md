# `VESignerExtension`

The `VESignerExtension` class inherits from the [`VEExtension` class](/guide/ethers-proxies/advanced/apis-in-depth/extensions/ve-extension) and is used to extend an Ethers.js `Signer` object without mutating it.

The Application Programming Interface of a `VESignerExtension` instance is currently empty.
