# `VEProviderPlaceholder`

The `VEProviderPlaceholder` class inherits from the [`VEPlaceholder` class](/guide/ethers-proxies/advanced/apis-in-depth/placeholders/ve-placeholder) and is used to associate properties and methods to a `VEProvider` even before the Ethers.js `Provider` object is available.

The Application Programming Interface of a `VEProviderPlaceholder` instance is currently empty.
