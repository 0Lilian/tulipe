# `VESignerPlaceholder`

The `VESignerPlaceholder` class inherits from the [`VEPlaceholder` class](/guide/ethers-proxies/advanced/apis-in-depth/placeholders/ve-placeholder) and is used to associate properties and methods to a `VESigner` even before the Ethers.js `Signer` object is available.

The Application Programming Interface of a `VESignerPlaceholder` instance is currently empty.
