# Introduction

Welcome to the Vuethers' documentation !

Here is our recommended way to parse it :
1) As you will notice most sections have an "Intuition" page, we really recommend reading that page before going to the rest of each section. In "Intuition" pages you will quickly learn about the context in which fits each Vuethers' part, as well as which are the problems and how it tries to solve them. **This will provides you a solid and intuitive basement** to understand the rest of the section's documentation.
2) We recommend you to start with the [Get started](/guide/get-started/) section in which you will learn how to **start a minimalist project with Vuethers**.
3) Then we invites you to parse the rest of the documentation in which  **the full power of Vuethers** will be taught to you. <span style="font-size: 20px;">üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span>

Enjoy !
